# TensorFlow In Action

## Chapter 1: The amazing world of TensorFlow

* Machine learning is the gatekepper that lets you cross from the world of data into the realm of information (e.g. actionable insights, useful patterns), bya llowing machines to learn from data.
* What is machine learning?
  * the process of training a computational model to predict some output given the data

### What is TensorFlow

* In its most raw form, TensorFlow provides three basic entities:
  * `tf.Variable`: a mutable data structure that can be used to store model parameters
  * `tf.Tensor`: immutable data structure that can be used to record data and interim and final ouputs of the model
  * `tf.Operation`: various operations provided in TensorFlow that are used to implement actual algorithms (e.g. matrix multiplication)
* Usually do not work at this level but rather use a higher level API such as Keras. 
* When a model is built, TensorFlow creates a data-flow graph and identifies hardware to execute on (e.g. GPU). 
* Tensorboard is a visualization tool to track the model as it trains.
* `SavedModel` used to save and store model
* TensorFlow serving helps deploy trained models and implement an API.
