# Deep Learning For Coders With fastai and PyTorch

## Chapter 1: Your Deep Learning Journey

* **Deep learning** is a computer technique to extract and transform data by using multiple layers of neural networks.
  
  * Each layer takes its inputs from previous layers and progressively refines them.
  
  * Use algorithm to minimize errors

* Approach
  
  * Teaching the whole game
  
  * Always teaching through examples
  
  * Simplifying as much as possible
  
  * Removing barriers

* Traits of successful deep learning practioners
  
  * playfulness
  
  * curiosity
