# Chapter 2: Preliminaries

* Can think about data as a table where rows correspond to examples and columns correspond to attributes
  
  * Linear alebgra

* Machine learning is about optimization of parameters
  
  * Calculus

* Reason about uncertainity
  
  * Probability

## Data Manipulation

* Two important things to do with data
  
  1. acquire data
  
  2. process data

* n-dimensional array: **tensor**

* the tensor object in PyTorch and  Tensorflow is like `ndarray` from NumPy except it supports
  
  * GPU computation
  
  * differentiation
