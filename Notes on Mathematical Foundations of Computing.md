## Chapter 1: Sets and Cantor's Theorem

### What is a set?

- **Definition:** A _set_ is an _unordered_ collection of _distinct_ elements.
- **Definition:** An _element_ is something contained within a set.
  - $x \in S$, $x \notin S$ 
- **Definition:** The _empty set_ is the set that does not contain any elements.
  - $\emptyset$ , $\forall x, x \notin \emptyset$

### Operations on sets

* **Definition:** The _intersection_ of two sets S and T, denoted S $\cap$ T, is the set of elements contained in both S and T.
